This is the second shift I've found the needles for CRI hetastarch disconnected  from the fluid line even though they were taped in. When you tape in needles/lines that need to stay in (because there's not a screw-on port), make sure to tape it really well, probably with at least one loop around the fluid line that's actually in the catheter and another couple of loops around the hetastarch needle and line, not just one loop around everything. Thanks for labeling the tape, though, it makes it easy to figure out that the hetastarch line should be connected and came loose. 

I can only find one thermometer and it's not working real well.  We shouldn't be immersing them in water to wash, just wipe all visible debris off then spray with alcohol and let dry. I think a lot of the thermometers stop working because they are getting washed in the sink and the water ruins the electronics. ","Tried to replace Max's, not successful"

Found an \"Aloe Vera Perineal Cleaner\" that can be used on sore bums. Its hanging out by the Desitin.

We had/have a protocol that all dogs under 5lbs & aren't eating get a catheter since they tend to go extremely downhill in just a night (and then its really difficult to get a catheter in). Its a protocol that's been in the wiki for over a year now, either started by Dr Eick or Johnson. Is everyone aware of this/current doctors on board with it?

We dumped several buckets of bleach water down the drains but it still smells bad :(

Please remove the bag and pump from the cage when a dog no longer needs it. Koko chewed through a third(?) IV line overnight :[

There was a roach/scream party this morning in here. There were 2 3-4 inch roaches in the main ward (we moved the hose from the back into the main ward and that's probably where they cam from). Then Amy cleaned out & bagged up some of the junk under the sinks in the second bathroom and there was a *shivers* nest of bugs in the corner, which we sprayed like crazy with the raid. We're both still super jumpy, in fact I just screamed 5 seconds ago because I thought something was on my hand...

The dogs were easy. The cats took much longer.

There's a gram scale by the sink to weight the kittens. Put them in the basket to weigh them. If you turn the scale on with the basket on top of it, it will account for the weight of the basket (tare) and you won't have to subtract the basket's weight. Or if you start it with nothing on top or switch baskets, push the power/tare button and it will account for the weight of the basket and go to 0 so you can weigh the cat. No manual subtraction necessary :)

If the kittens have lo st weight or not gained any, please force feed them and let a doctor know. 

Weighing the kittens before and after feeding lets us keep track of how much they've eaten

The kittens in the back have one chart for the whole litter. They all get the same things and their weights are recorded individually. 

To the people writing charts: please assume we know absolutely nothing about cats, including coat descriptions. We get lots of training on dogs but none on cats. So abbreviations like \"torti\" for tortise-shell coat don't mean anything to some of us. (BTW parvo peeps, a tortoiseshell cat is black, white, and orange mixed all around, like calico but with the colors more mixed, not in distinct patches. )","Ariel II"

2 cans left of castor and pollux wet cat food.

Just a reminder to use standard precautions in between cages as in spraying down the scale and bucket and areas where you treated if on the counter.

One of the cords for the pumps was shorting out, so it tripped the GFCI circuit breaker thing and a couple of outlets weren't working this morning. It was definitely the cord not the pump, because just plugging the cord in without a pump tripped the GFCI and turned off the outlet. I had a moment of panic because not all the outlets have reset buttons, but then I pressed the buttons on the outlets that did and found out that the reset buttons for one outlet work on the nearby outlets as well. So all the power outlets are working again. And we're short a cord, I'll aske about getting it repaired or replaced. It has no visible damage. 

It might not seem like it but we did a bunch of laundry. I'm gonna start cleaning runs and kennels in a minute. 

On the subject of damaged cords, I threw away one heating pad because hte cord was really chewed all over the place and duck taped the cord of another that had one pretty good hole in the plastic of the cord.

A smarter hat than me.

You can keep your bowlers black,

For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
And I can cap them all.

There's nothing hidden in your head
The Sorting Hat can't see,
So try me on and I will tell you
Where you ought to be.

You might belong in Gryffindor,
Where dwell the brave at heart,
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
Set Gryffindors apart;

You might belong in Hufflepuff,
Where they are just and loyal,
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
And unafraid of toil;

Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
if you've a ready mind,
Where those of wit and learning,
Will always find their kind;

Or perhaps in Slytherin
You'll make your real friends,
Those cunning folks use any means
To achieve their ends.

And don't get in a flap!

FYI there's not much you can do for a seizing dog. Just make sure they don't hurt themselves by falling out of the cage or impaling themselves on a nearby needle or something. They won't swallow their tongues, don't mess with their mouths or you may get bitten by accident. Don't try to get them to eat or drink anything during the seizure, they are likely to choke on it. Call a vet, try to time the seizure. If you're not totally sure of what you're seeing, take a video. A vet may prescribe meds to give during or after prolonged or repeated seizures, but they are not medications we routinely keep in here and they are not given orally.

Not sure why, but I noticed that when I add bleach to water and laundry detergent mixing in the tub it turns orange for a minute, so it's probably reacting somehow. There isn't any smell or toxic fumes, and neither product says not to use with the other. I've only noticed this happening with the current Safeway brand detergent and both bottles of splash-less bleach. If this continues to happen with other brands of detergent, we may need to make sure we stop getting splash-less bleach to see if it stops just in case the reaction messes with the disinfecting properties of the bleach.

Do not move parvo tests from one box to the other or use a test from a different box than the swab! The test must be from the same box with the same lot number as the swab or the results are not valid. A couple days ago I found a box with one swab and no tests, so I threw it away. Today I found a box with two tests and one swab, so I had to throw the \"extra\" test away. There is NO REASON that you would ever need anything other than one test and one swab to test a dog, using anything else than one of each means the results are invalid, the test will have to be repeated. Each test+swab costs $20 and every orphan swab or orphaned test is one we can't use on a dog. Even if you are doing a group test, you use one swab on up to 3 dogs with one test, so the number of swabs in the box should always be the same as the number of tests. If you are confused, talk to me so we don't keep wasting tests. ",NA

So here's a sink update: I used my handyman skills and was able to remove the old faucet (which REALLY should have been changed a while ago...).  Everything is severely rusted through.  After much struggle (stripped pieces, lack of tools, wrong tools, etc) I was able to replace the faucet.  With all of this, the shut off valves are in desperate need of being replaced.  The cold water valve snapped off when I was shutting the water off...  SO we have fully functioning, full pressure hot water right now (luckily our hot water is not very hot).

Do not give dogs real bones. The meat on them is generally fatty and can cause diarrhea or even pancreatitis if they get too much. Bones are also too hard and will break dogs' teeth (dogs' enamel is actually softer than ours). If the bones break they can have sharp splinters that can cut a dog's mouth. And if a dog swallows the bones, they can sometimes cause obstructions that require surgery. If you want to feed your own dog bones that's up to you, but no real bones in parvo. Rawhides are OK because they soften as they are chewed and toys made to be chewed are also fine, but no bones. ",NA

Usually I fill up the spray bottle about 1/2 inch with bleach then to the brim with water to dilute it. Using straight bleach will kill parvo, but it will also make your eyes, lungs, and skin burn, so dilute it. 

I brought a couple of different new fly killers, since the houseflies are becoming insanely numerous back here and it's disgusting. The doctors said it's OK and I put them out of reach of the dogs. There are two clear-ish stickers with a layer of bait attached to the mirrors in the bathrooms, they have writing on them to identify them as poison. Do not touch them, they are toxic. If you have to take them off  use the edges of the stickers where there is not chemical and then wash your hands, but they should last for several weeks. The package they came in is in the left-hand drawer by the sink under the red organizer basket if anybody ever needs MSDS-type information. There is another bottle-style trap that has (supposedly nontoxic) bait dissolved in water on top of the fridge, the idea is that the flies smell the bait, fly in, get stuck, and drown. Keep it up there, don't knock it over, and keep it out of reach of the dogs.

I learned a new thing today: we are supposed to dilute the marquis that comes in the tubes meant for horses 1:2, so for every part marquis we add, we need to also add two parts water. This is per Dr. Barz, and we have been doing it wrong. (It's not your fault, it's kind of mine but I actually asked someone in the clinic about this when they gave me the last tube of marquis (since it seemed nuts to me to give horse dewormer to dogs) and whoever it was (I can't remember, it was weeks ago) said to use it as is, ... too late now...)

There is absolutely no reason for us to ever have an uneven number of tests and swabs, one test is always used with one swab.

If you are not sure how to do a parvo test, please tell me and we will review it. If we are not performing the test exactly how the manual says, our results are not valid, and by using extra swabs somewhere we are wasting money, each test costs $20. Test results are only valid if the test is run with a swab with the same lot number, which is why we have to throw away extra tests rather than save them for later.",NA

Renal diets are formulated for dogs in kidney failure and therefore are much lower in protein than regular food. Since we are trying to get the parvo dogs' protein levels up, this is not what we want. If you ever see a prescription food that you're not sure is appropriate, please ask a doctor if they want us to use it. If the clinic tries to give you a prescription food that is not appropriate for parvo, don't take it. 

I added a bit to the wiki about which common prescription foods are good for parvo dogs and which are not, since there are so many different foods with similar-sounding names. (The common good ones are a/d, recovery, CN, i/d, EN, and Gastro-Intestinal)

Monica said it was red hot and caught a pillow on fire. As far as I know the pillow was the only casualty and there was no other damage.

It sounds like the problem is that somebody outside put a big pile of stuffed animals and pillows right in front of the vent, blocking it and causing heat to build up. Faith is going to make sure this is the case and make sure it won't happen again, so don't use the dryer until she says. The dryer is fine and I checked the flexible duct and the wall duct and there wasn't any significant amount of lint in them (I cleaned out the small amount that was there) and they didn't seem unusually hot on our side. The dryer is unplugged and has a sign on it for now.

Kennels A, B, and C's plugs were not working when I came in, so pumps were screaming that they had low batteries. Fortunately Rene (?) figured out they are on a GFCI outlet, so it just had to be reset.

Solo shifts with this many dogs is grueling.",NA

I folded all the laundry including all the scrubs. The washer is definitely off, but still washing so I kept going. The laundry room floor looks awful. There is a BUNCH of trash and recycling that needs to be taken out. I bagged some of it, but I need another person to help me double bag it, so maybe the three people here tomorrow morning can get that done. :) I sprayed down all the equipment we aren't using now, but tonight they need to be wiped down and put away.
This was my first time meeting Diana. She is a doll and was a HUGE help. She had to leave early to take her dad to the airport, but that would have been 2 and a half more hours I would have been here. Thank you!!

Katie, you are absolutely going to need help tonight. If no one else can come, I can come for maybe an hour or two. Let me know.

Sloane's transfusion took forever, without that the shift would have been at least an hour faster and possibly more. I couldn't use the pump for it so I had to give the blood slowly from syringes. ",NA

We swept and mopped and took out tons of trash and recycling. Please don't let the recycling become a giant precarious pile, just tie up the black bag when it's full and get a new one for the bin like you would with trash. 

We were probably done with treatments around 9:45 and then we cleaned until about 10:45 and then Lauren and I practiced blood draws and PCVs and catheter placement until noon, so the shift didn't take as long as you think :)",NA
