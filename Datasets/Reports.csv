Lowered LRS fluid rate to 3 ml/hour per Dr. K. Vomited bile and mucous before anti-emetics. Runny yellow diarrhea just sort of leaking. Had 3 rounds of hetastarch totaling 20 mL. Also got Cefazolin, Cerenia, and Famotadine. We couldn't force feed her because she wouldn't swallow, so we put some nutri-cal on her gums. She got a plasma transfusion after her other treatments because she still didn't look good. Then got a blood transfusion. Treat her first please and send loving thoughts her way; she looks really bad.

Safara- Starting to be interested in food, ate a bunch of warmed up recovery. Nebulized for about an hour. Got IV baytril tons of IV meds as well as oral cough tabs and sucaralfate. We piggybacked her bag, so she's definitely good until morning. 

Elvis- QAR, pale, warm. On pump with all adds and IV treatment. Got hetastarch bolus. No D but vomited several times during the shift. FF 2 cc recovery. Dr. K gave him a plasma transfusion too, since we brought the plasma back for Betty Sue and the leftover shouldn't go to waste.

Gave Hetastarch bolus and meds, got pinker and warmer, still not great. After treatment (we hope) catheter blew, Dr. Barz will place a jugular catheter later because all his legs are done. He's had lots of bloody diarrhea with tissue cause he's got a leaky butt. I force fed him after treatment but he vomited up the food and some blood. 

Grizzly- New, RTO. Owners had been doing at-home treatment for three days but he wasn't improving. Did SQ's, he's vomited 4 times, may need to be on an IV. QAR, pink, paws were cold but he was also wet, so I put him on a heating pad. Watch him carefully please. He's a little snappy sometimes, so go slow and be careful. I think he's just scared and needles hurt. He never actually got me and was fine once the fluids were running. Vaccinated. Had round of bloody diarrhea right as I was about to leave so placed catheter, started on pump with all adds and gave hetastarch bolus. 

Toby- Vomited several times, had some bloody and some brown diarrhea, leaky butt. QAR, pink, warm. I piggybacked a new bag so he should be good on fluids. ","Koko- on pump because of her size, ate all her BF, no V or D in the cage, very hyper and wiggly, she chewed through her line during the night, new line was sprayed with bitter apple, we tried a different e collar because she kept pulling the old one half way off so it was stuck in her mouth. The new one stays on better but she can't really eat with it, so maybe take it off for a few minutes when she gets fed. She ate a bunch of baby food for me.  

Michelle-had bloody D during shift, a little nervous, needs to be muzzled during treatment. Holly took her out and held her and she was really good, just scared in the cage. 

Harold- New, owner surrender. 3.5 lbs, so even though he's fine he might need a catheter tonight because he's so small. Cute. BAR, pink, warm. Not eating or drinking, no V/D. Vomited yesterday at home.

There are a lot of flies back here right now.

We had/have a protocol that all dogs under 5lbs & aren't eating get a catheter since they tend to go extremely downhill in just a night (and then its really difficult to get a catheter in). Its a protocol that's been in the wiki for over a year now, either started by Dr Eick or Johnson. Is everyone aware of this/current doctors on board with it?

We dumped several buckets of bleach water down the drains but it still smells bad :(

Please remove the bag and pump from the cage when a dog no longer needs it. Koko chewed through a third(?) IV line overnight :[

There was a roach/scream party this morning in here. There were 2 3-4 inch roaches in the main ward (we moved the hose from the back into the main ward and that's probably where they cam from). Then Amy cleaned out & bagged up some of the junk under the sinks in the second bathroom and there was a *shivers* nest of bugs in the corner, which we sprayed like crazy with the raid.

Her catheter blew during the day so her leg was really swollen and painful.

Kittens- QAR, squirmy, wanted to climb my shirt all the time but their claws were really sharp. I fed them first thing and they all seemed hungry and ate enthusiastically from the syringe. I fed them again at noon and they were less enthuesiastic, it was more force feeding than letting them eat from the syringe. Also, I checked with Dr. Barz and we don't want to bathe them or get them wet, so resist the temptation to rinse them off when you're done (the food gets all over their faces and feet), just wipe them off with a towel. Jordana gave me EN food for them, there are 2 more small cans with the rest of the food.

There's a gram scale by the sink to weight the kittens. Put them in the basket to weigh them.

Weighing the kittens before and after feeding lets us keep track of how much they've eaten

The kittens in the back have one chart for the whole litter. They all get the same things and their weights are recorded individually. 

To the people writing charts: please assume we know absolutely nothing about cats, including coat descriptions. We get lots of training on dogs but none on cats.

One of the cords for the pumps was shorting out, so it tripped the GFCI circuit breaker thing and a couple of outlets weren't working this morning. It was definitely the cord not the pump, because just plugging the cord in without a pump tripped the GFCI and turned off the outlet. I had a moment of panic because not all the outlets have reset buttons, but then I pressed the buttons on the outlets that did and found out that the reset buttons for one outlet work on the nearby outlets as well. So all the power outlets are working again. And we're short a cord, I'll aske about getting it repaired or replaced. It has no visible damage. 

It might not seem like it but we did a bunch of laundry. I'm gonna start cleaning runs and kennels in a minute. 

On the subject of damaged cords, I threw away one heating pad because hte cord was really chewed all over the place and duck taped the cord of another that had one pretty good hole in the plastic of the cord.

All kittens lost weight last night because they weren't fed after 8:30 pm until we fed them this morning. All were force fed 5% of body weight. 

Vina (no dot in ear) ate well from syringe, all the others were hard to feed and didn't want to eat. Vina ate a little bit of gruel from the dish on her own but not enough.

I caught one of the V kittens feet in a door for a second as I closed it. I think he/she's ok, but if he starts limping that's why :( 

Ahoy vomited during force feeding and had yellowish runny diarrhea when stimulated as well as diarrhea in cage.

Where dwell the brave at heart,
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry

You might belong in Hufflepuff,
Where they are just and loyal,
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
And unafraid of toil;

Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
if you've a ready mind,
Where those of wit and learning,
Will always find their kind;

Or perhaps in Slytherin
You'll make your real friends,
Those cunning folks use any means
To achieve their ends.

Aranca had a seizure at the end of the shift. It started with repetitive licking and chewing, and foaming at the mouth then progressed to falling over and twitching/jerking. The siezure lasted about 2-3 minutes, the part I saw lasted about 2 minutes but I think I missed the beginning. The whole litter is ON DISTEMPER WATCH due to this. They have been moved to the back bathrooms. Please alert DVM if you see any other neurological issues or more seizures. Aranca will need anti-seizure medications if the seizures continue. Some are missing patches of hair, so they probably also have mange.

FYI there's not much you can do for a seizing dog. Just make sure they don't hurt themselves by falling out of the cage or impaling themselves on a nearby needle or something. They won't swallow their tongues, don't mess with their mouths or you may get bitten by accident. Don't try to get them to eat or drink anything during the seizure, they are likely to choke on it. Call a vet, try to time the seizure. If you're not totally sure of what you're seeing, take a video. A vet may prescribe meds to give during or after prolonged or repeated seizures, but they are not medications we routinely keep in here and they are not given orally.

Whoever did the intake and wrote up and gave yesterday's treatments got the kittens' weight WAY off. (This was not a parvo volunteer, I believe it was someone from the clinic. The doctors are looking into it.) Emily weighs 0.94 lbs (435 g) this morning but her treatment sheet said 3.9 lbs. Earl weighs 1.2 lbs (555 g) this morning but his chart said 5.3 lbs. Consequently they both recieved massive overdoses of everything last night. Also, the canine dose of baytril is 5x higher than the feline dose of baytril, so between the incorrect weight and the incorrect dose, the kittens got 20x more baytril than they should have. We are lucky they are still alive. They were given 4x more Cerenia, Polyflex, and LRS than they should have. 

I recalculated the medication doses and wrote new treatment sheets. After talking to Dr. Ramsey I only gave the kittens LRS this morning, no other medications.  

The kittens are both alert, Emily is on the lethargic side of QAR and mostly lays on the warm snuggle disk, but she looks up if  you make noise and crawled around when in my lap. Earl was on the brighter side of QAR, he sat up and meowed at me the whole time I was treating and writing charts. Earl is having more diarrhea, his bottom is very red.

In case anyone is concerned that we are not giving tramadol, she got BupSR on Sunday night. BupSR is an extended release opioid that lasts for 72 hours, so she is on pain medication. I had to look up BupSR when I saw it on the chart so I figured I'd pass the information along to the rest of you.

Tonight's shift should be pretty short, if anybody can come in to help out Christopher. Email or text Katie if you can. 

Do not move parvo tests from one box to the other or use a test from a different box than the swab! The test must be from the same box with the same lot number as the swab or the results are not valid. A couple days ago I found a box with one swab and no tests, so I threw it away. Today I found a box with two tests and one swab, so I had to throw the \"extra\" test away. There is NO REASON that you would ever need anything other than one test and one swab to test a dog, using anything else than one of each means the results are invalid, the test will have to be repeated. Each test+swab costs $20 and every orphan swab or orphaned test is one we can't use on a dog. Even if you are doing a group test, you use one swab on up to 3 dogs with one test, so the number of swabs in the box should always be the same as the number of tests.

We don't want it piling up back here, there are already tons of flies.

Do not give dogs real bones. The meat on them is generally fatty and can cause diarrhea or even pancreatitis if they get too much. Bones are also too hard and will break dogs' teeth (dogs' enamel is actually softer than ours). If the bones break they can have sharp splinters that can cut a dog's mouth. And if a dog swallows the bones, they can sometimes cause obstructions that require surgery. If you want to feed your own dog bones that's up to you, but no real bones in parvo. Rawhides are OK because they soften as they are chewed and toys made to be chewed are also fine, but no bones.

We clean with bleach diluted 1:30, not straight bleach. Usually I fill up the spray bottle about 1/2 inch with bleach then to the brim with water to dilute it. Using straight bleach will kill parvo, but it will also make your eyes, lungs, and skin burn, so dilute it. 

I brought a couple of different new fly killers, since the houseflies are becoming insanely numerous back here and it's disgusting. The doctors said it's OK and I put them out of reach of the dogs. There are two clear-ish stickers with a layer of bait attached to the mirrors in the bathrooms, they have writing on them to identify them as poison. Do not touch them, they are toxic. If you have to take them off  use the edges of the stickers where there is not chemical and then wash your hands, but they should last for several weeks. The package they came in is in the left-hand drawer by the sink under the red organizer basket if anybody ever needs MSDS-type information. There is another bottle-style trap that has (supposedly nontoxic) bait dissolved in water on top of the fridge, the idea is that the flies smell the bait, fly in, get stuck, and drown. Keep it up there, don't knock it over, and keep it out of reach of the dogs.

I learned a new thing today: we are supposed to dilute the marquis that comes in the tubes meant for horses 1:2, so for every part marquis we add, we need to also add two parts water. This is per Dr. Barz, and we have been doing it wrong. (It's not your fault, it's kind of mine but I actually asked someone in the clinic about this when they gave me the last tube of marquis (since it seemed nuts to me to give horse dewormer to dogs) and whoever it was (I can't remember, it was weeks ago) said to use it as is, ... too late now...) Anyway, now the marquis is correctly diluted and in a dispenser bottle.

I let him wander around and he did NOT like it when I tried to slip a blue leash over his head, he yelped and snapped at that, but then let me catch him with a towel again and sat in my lap for while longer.

As far as I know the pillow was the only casualty and there was no other damage.

It sounds like the problem is that somebody outside put a big pile of stuffed animals and pillows right in front of the vent, blocking it and causing heat to build up.
