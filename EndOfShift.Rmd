This analysis utilizes data from the *Parvo ICU End of Shift Report* submitted at the end of each shift. It has not been cross-validated against independent (and official) data sources like PetPoint of MyVolunteerPage, and therefore might contain some erroneous data points.

Using data submitted at the end of shifts via the *Parvo ICU End of Shift Report*, 
this analysis explores from the trends and patterns in the Parvo ICU over 
multiple years. Data spans from `r floor_date(min(Numerical$Timestamp), "day")` 
to `r floor_date(max(Numerical$Timestamp), "day")` and represents `r nrow(Numerical)` 
total observations (e.g. End of Shift submissions).

# Volunteers 

First, we'll take a look at the volunteers and staff who were listed as a 
response to the **Shift Staff/Volunteers** question on the report. Responses have
been modified to fix misspellings and standardize the format. 

```{r define_Vols.df}
Vols <- Numerical %>%
  select(Timestamp, Shift.Time) %>% # Grab the time and duration of shift
  bind_cols(Names$Vols) %>%         # Bind the table of volunteer attendence
  
  # Gather the table in long format by volunteer name
  gather(Volunteer, Value, -Timestamp, -Shift.Time) %>%
  filter(Value) %>%                 # Filter dates where vol wasn't there
  
  # Only vols with 10+ shifts
  group_by(Volunteer) %>% filter(9<n())
```

Responses lists names as a comma separated list, like the one below. The method
of parsing names is fairly indiscreet, and identified a total of 
`r ncol(Names$Vols)` unique names across all submissions. For the sake of 
simplicity, only names appearing 10 or more times have been counted. By applying
this filter, the number of names counted was reduced to 
`r nrow(count(Vols, Volunteer))`.

Additional complications arose from volunteers sharing the same first name. 
Sometimes submissions will specify which volunteer was present by including their
last initial, but often this information is omitted. Therefore, there is a great
deal of cross over among a few volunteers with common names, but unfortunatly 
this is unavoidable. 

In cases where a volunteer/staff was listed as training a new volunteer (e.g. 
Katie training Hunter), both the trainer and trainee have been counted. 

> *Volunteer*, *Volunteer*, ...   
> *Volunteer*, *Trainer* training *Trainee*


To begin, here's a table of the top 25 volunteers, sorted by the number of 
shifts for which they've been present:

```{r}
Vols %>% count(Volunteer, sort=T) %>% slice(1:25) %>% knitr::kable()
```

## Heatmaps

<h3> Who volunteers together </h3>

Below is a correlation matrix represented as a heatmap. The values (colors of 
the blocks) the correlation co-efficient of the number of shifts worked per week
by using the *pearson* method. Higher values represent an increased likelihood
that those two volunteers volunteered during the same week. 

```{r}
df <- Vols %>%
  group_by(Volunteer, Week=floor_date(Timestamp, "week")) %>%
  summarise(Shifts = n()) %>%
  spread(Volunteer, Shifts, fill = 0) 

row.names(df) <- df$Week
df$Week <- NULL
cor(df) %>% d3heatmap::d3heatmap()
rm(df)
```

The numerical value is probably of little practical signifigance, but the 
general clustering (represented by "chunks" of similar colors, or by the 
dendograms on either side of the plot) do help to highlight different clusters 
of volunteers. 

<h3> Who volunteers by day of the week and AM/PM </h3>

Next, we'll look at another heatmap. This time, however, the numerical values 
are indicative of the number of shifts that each volunteer has been present for
at each time of the day/week. 

```{r}
df <- Vols %>%
  filter(Volunteer!="Katie") %>%
  group_by(Volunteer, wkday=paste(wday(Timestamp, label = T), 
                                  ifelse(am(Timestamp), "AM", "PM"))) %>%
  summarise(Shifts = n()) %>%
  filter(10<sum(Shifts)) %>%
  spread(Volunteer, Shifts, fill = 0) 

row.names(df) <- df$wkday
df$wkday <- NULL
t(df) %>% d3heatmap::d3heatmap(scale="row")
rm(df)
```

This figure is colored relative to each volunteer (i.e. by row), so it 
highlights what days/time each volunteer prefers. The most useful conclusion we
may derive here is the noticable lack of crossover between AM and PM volunteers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Violin/Boxplots

<h3> Engagement Over Time </h3>

This figure demonstrates the patterns of shifts by each volunteer (with more 
than 10 shifts total) over the duration of thier time as a Parvo volunteer/staff

```{r, fig.height=8}
Vols %>% 
  group_by(Volunteer) %>%
  mutate(First = min(Timestamp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(factor(Volunteer), First), y=Timestamp)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  geom_point(aes(color=Shift.Time), alpha=0.5) + 
  
  scale_color_continuous_tableau(name="Shift Duration") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(axis.title = element_text()) +
  scale_y_datetime(date_labels = "%b %y", date_breaks="3 months") +
  labs(x="Volunteer/Staff", y="", title="Volunteer/Staff Activity Over Time",
       subtitle="For Volunteers/Staff with 10+ Shifts") +
  coord_flip()
```

Each point represents one shift (colored by how long the shift lasted). Compared
to other [volunteer oppurtunites](http://goo.gl/vqraBD) at Austin Pets Alive!, 
Parvo actually has a very [high reternion rate](http://goo.gl/wMQVcs), 
especially among those who have been here for over a year.

<h3> Monthly Engagement </h3>

Another way to conceptualize this might be to look at the number of 

```{r, fig.height=8}
df <- Vols %>% 
  filter(Volunteer!="Katie") %>%
  group_by(Volunteer, Month=floor_date(Timestamp, "month")) %>%
  summarise(Shifts=n(), Shift.Time=sum(Shift.Time)) %>%
  filter(Shifts>0) %>%
  group_by(Volunteer) 

gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  {df %>%
  summarise(Shift.Time=sum(Shift.Time), Months=n(), Shifts=sum(Shifts)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Months, y=Shifts)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size=Shift.Time), alpha=0.3) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(axis.title = element_text()) +
  labs(x="Months Active", y="Number of Shifts", 
       title="Number of Shifts by Months Active")},
  {df %>%
  mutate(Shift.Time=sum(Shift.Time), Months=n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Volunteer, Shift.Time), y=Shifts)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=Shift.Time), alpha=0.7) +
  
  scale_fill_continuous_tableau(name="Total Hours") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(axis.title = element_text()) +
  labs(x="Volunteer/Staff", y="Shifts Per Month", title="Shifts Per Month by Volunteer",
       subtitle="For Volunteers/Staff with 10+ Shifts") +
  coord_flip()},
  ncol=2)
rm(df)  


```



## Rolling Hours by days since start

```{r}
Vols %>% 
  group_by(Volunteer) %>%
  mutate(
    Hours = order_by(Timestamp, cumsum(Shift.Time)),
    # Start = floor_date(min(Timestamp), "day"),
    ddif = as.numeric(as.duration(interval(floor_date(min(Timestamp), "day"), floor_date(Timestamp, "day")))/86400),
    Len  = max(ddif)) %>%
  filter(Volunteer!="Katie") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ddif, y=Hours, group=Volunteer)) + geom_line(aes(color=Len)) + 
  labs(x="Days since start")
```

```{r}
Vols %>% 
  group_by(Volunteer, Week=floor_date(Timestamp, "week")) %>%
  summarise(Shifts=n(), Shift.Time=sum(Shift.Time)) %>%
  filter(Shifts>0) %>% 
  group_by(Month=floor_date(Week, "month")) %>% mutate(nVols.m = n_distinct(Volunteer)) %>%
  group_by(Week, Month, nVols.m) %>% summarise(
    nVols.wk = n_distinct(Volunteer),
    Shift.Time = mean(Shift.Time)) %>%
  filter(Week<ymd("2016-03-27")) %>%
  # View()
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=Week, y=nVols.wk, size=Shift.Time), alpha=0.5) +
  
  geom_smooth(aes(x=Week, y=nVols.wk), color="red") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(axis.title = element_text()) +
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%b %y", date_breaks="3 months") +
  labs(x="", y="Unique Volunteers", title="Unique Volunteers Per Week")
```
# How About The Dogs?

First, we'll run an unadjusted linear model based on the number of dogs at each level that are in the ICU 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9}
Dogs <- tbl_df(Numerical) %>%
  mutate(
    Date = floor_date(Timestamp-hours(3), "day"),
    AM   = am(Timestamp-hours(ceiling(Shift.Time)))) %>%
  select(Date, AM, Duration=Shift.Time, Vols=Count_Vols, Total=Dogs.in.ICU,
         Critical=Count_Crt, Intermediate=Count_Int, Well=Count_Wel, Timestamp) %>%
  mutate(AM = ifelse(AM, "AM", "PM")) %>%
  gather(Level, Dogs, Critical:Well) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=8}
Dogs %>%     
  ggplot(aes(x=Date, y=Dogs, color=Level)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.1) + geom_smooth(linetype=2) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(
    axis.title         = element_text(),
    panel.grid.minor   = element_line(color="#e6e6e6"), 
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%b %y", date_breaks="3 months", date_minor_breaks="1 month") +
  labs(x="", title="Number of Dogs Over Time (By Level)") 
```

It's difficult to extrapolate the seasonal trends based on two springs, but if we assume that
this sinusoidal pattern were to continue, we should expect a huge peak this summer, since March
is only the beginning of the upswing for Parvo season.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=8}
df <- Dogs %>% 
  group_by(Level, Month=floor_date(Date, "month")) %>% 
  summarise(Avg=mean(as.numeric(Dogs))) 
Dogs %>%     
  ggplot(aes(x=Date, y=Dogs, color=Level)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.1) +
  geom_line(aes(color=Level, x=Month, y=Avg), alpha=0.9, data=df) +
  geom_label(aes(color=Level, label=round(Avg, 1), x=Month, y=Avg), data=df, size=2.2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(
    axis.title         = element_text(),
    panel.grid.minor   = element_line(color="#e6e6e6"), 
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%b %y", date_breaks="3 months", date_minor_breaks="1 month") +
  labs(x="", title="Number of Dogs Over Time (By Level)", subtitle="With Monthly Averages Labeled") 
```

But obviously, there's a whole lot of variance from the mean

```{r, fig.width=10}
Dogs %>% 
  group_by(Level, m=floor_date(Date, "month")) %>% 
  group_by(Level) %>% mutate(
    Year = year(m),
    Month = month(m, label=T)) %>%
  ggplot((aes(x=Month, y=Dogs, fill=Level))) + geom_boxplot() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(
    axis.title         = element_text(),
    panel.grid.minor   = element_line(color="#e6e6e6"), 
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    strip.background  = element_rect(fill="#e3e3e3")) +
  facet_grid(Year~Level)
```

```{r}
Dogs %>% 
  group_by(Level, Month=floor_date(Date, "month")) %>% 
  summarise(Avg=mean(as.numeric(Dogs))) %>%
  group_by(Month) %>% mutate(Avg.Total = sum(Avg)) %>%
  group_by(Level) %>% mutate(
    Year = year(Month),
    Month = month(Month, label=T),
    Avg = round(Avg, 2),
    Avg.Total = round(Avg.Total, 2)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(Year), y=Month, label=Avg, fill=Avg.Total, alpha=Avg)) + 
  geom_bin2d() + geom_text(aes(size=Avg), color="black", alpha=1) +
  coord_flip() + facet_wrap("Level", ncol=1) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "BrBG", name="Total In ICU") +
  guides(size=F, alpha=F) + theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(), strip.background  = element_rect(fill="#e3e3e3"))+
  labs(y="", x="", title="Average Number of Dogs by Level (Monthly)",
       subtitle="The size of the numbers & transperancy of the bin is proportional to the level's number")
```



# Inventory/Supplies

Create a data.frame of all the Inventory requests

```{r}
Supplies <- Inventory %>%
  select(Timestamp) %>% 
  bind_cols(Inventory$Invn.Supplies) %>% select(-`NA`, -None) %>%
  bind_cols(Inventory$Invn.Medications) %>% select(-`NA`, -None) %>%
  bind_cols(Inventory$Invn.MedSupplies) %>% select(-`NA`, -None) %>%
  gather(Supply, Value, -Timestamp) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Value)) %>%
  filter(Value) 
```

# pv %>% plot() # dendogram with p values
# pv %>% pvrect(alpha=0.95) # add rectangles around groups highly supported by the data


Numerical %>% 
  # Group by the time sent minus 3 hours b/c timestamp may be @ 1:00 AM
  group_by(Date = floor_date(Timestamp-hours(3), "day")) %>%

  group_by(Week=floor_date(Date, "week")) %>%

  left_join(
    Supplies %>%

      summarise(Requests.Week = n())
  ) %>%
  # ggplot(aes(x=Requests.Week, y=Dog.Days)) + geom_jitter() + facet_wrap("Supply")
  ggplot(aes(x=Week, y=Supply)) + 
  geom_rug(sides = "b", aes(alpha=Dog.Days, color=Dog.Days/7), size=2) +
